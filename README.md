Geni-Pass

Overview
In our daily lives, we frequently rely on passwords to protect our most sensitive information, such as email and bank account details. The use of secure passwords is necessary to shield us from unauthorized access and potential fraudulent activities that could jeopardize our security. A weak password is one that can be easily guessed due to its simplicity. Such passwords often consist of common words, basic phrases, or predictable sequences such as "password," "123456," and lack a diverse mix of characters.

Recognizing the need for stronger password security, we have envisioned **Geni-Pass**, a secure password generator. This program is designed to allow users to tailor their passwords' length and strength according to their preferences. Geni-Pass offers the option to include a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. These elements are randomly combined to ensure the generation of a strong password.

For instance, if you require a password incorporating uppercase letters, numbers, and special characters, Geni-Pass will integrate these elements, producing a strong and reliable password. Moreover, Geni-Pass caters to those who prefer a personal touch in their password. It allows users to incorporate a specific word of their choice into the password while still ensuring the inclusion of a random selection of user-specified characters, maintaining the strength of the password. Our goal with Geni-Pass is to make the creation of secure passwords straightforward and reliable.

Features
- Customizable Password Length: Users can specify the desired length of the password, with a minimum length of 8 to ensure strength.
- Multiple Password Generation: Generate multiple passwords in a single run based on user input.
- Character Type Selection: Include or exclude uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters according to your requirements.
- Personalized Passwords: Option to incorporate a specific word into the password while maintaining its security.
- Randomized Outputs: Uses randomization to ensure every password is unique and secure.
